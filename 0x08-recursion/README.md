0x08. C - Recursion
In C, When a function calls a copy of itself then the process is known as Recursion. To put it short, when a function calls itself then this technique is known as Recursion. And the function is known as a recursive function.
Recursion can be used in case of similar subtasks like sorting, searching, and traversal problems. While using recursion, you will have to define an exit condition on that function, if not then it will go into an infinite loop.
